As React components become the building blocks of our application, styling them becomes a crucial part of our development. Scaling these styles as our codebase grows is critical â€“ balancing modularity, performance, and developer experience.

Today, there are many ways to apply styles to your React, just to name a few popular methods:

- [Inline Styles](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#style)
- [CSS Classes](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-styling.html#how-do-i-add-css-classes-to-components)
- [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
- [CSS-in-JS](https://github.com/tuchk4/awesome-css-in-js)
- [Stylable](https://stylable.io)

Let's take a closer look at a CSS-in-JS approach used by [Theme UI] which provides amazing developer ergonomics while respecting design constraints.

## A quick setup

The up-coming examples assume a project that has already been set up with Theme UI. To set up a project with Theme UI:

- Install the Theme UI package with `npm i theme-ui`
- Wrap your application with the `ThemeProvider` passing in the `theme` object as a prop
- See the [Getting Started] section for more details

## The sx prop

Theme UI introduces a powerful styling feature, the [sx prop]. This prop lets you style elements inline using values from your [theme](https://theme-ui.com/theming).

You can add the `sx` prop to your JSX elements by simply adding the custom `/** @jsx jsx */` pragma comment to the top of your file and importing the `jsx` function from `theme-ui`.

```jsx
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx } from 'theme-ui';

export default (props) => (
  <div
    {...props}
    sx={{
      // values referencing scales defined in a theme
      color: 'primary',
      bg: 'background',
      fontFamily: 'body',
      // raw CSS value
      boxShadow: '0 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, .125)',
    }}
  />
);
```

This is a similar method to the [Emotion] `css` prop, but now we have the nifty features of Theme UI:

- [Theme-Aware Properties]()
- [Responsive Values]()
- [Functional Values]()

## First-class component support

Instead of bringing in all of Theme UI into our project, we can leverage the smaller [`@theme-ui/css`] package to add `sx` prop powers to individual components. Theme UI uses this package to add `sx` prop support to its foundational Box component.

```jsx
/**
 * Simplified modification of the Theme UI Box
 * http://bit.ly/3pzPiAr
 */

import styled from '@emotion/styled';
import { css } from '@theme-ui/css';

// Parse the style objects passed via `sx` to the `css(...)` function
const sx = (props) => css(props.sx)(props.theme);

const Box = styled.div(
  {
    boxSizing: 'border-box',
    margin: 0,
    minWidth: 0,
  },
  sx,
  (props) => props.css
);

export default Box;
```

Now, Box has `sx` prop support integrated into the component and can be used without the need for the JSX pragma.

```jsx
/** No need to import the theme-ui jsx pragma! */
import Box from './components/Box'

export const Card = ({ sx, ...props }) => (
  <Box
    {...props}
    sx={{
      border: '1px solid',
      borderColor: 'border',
      borderRadius: "grayLight"
      p: 3,
      ...sx
    }}
  />
)

export default Card;
```

Moving the `sx` function to its own utility file, this helper can be used to add the `sx` prop as a first-class styling feature for any component.

```jsx
import styled from '@emotion/styled';
import sx from '../utils/sx';

const Button = styled.button(
  {
    appearance: 'none',
    display: 'inline-block',
    textAlign: 'center',
    lineHeight: 'inherit',
    textDecoration: 'none',
    fontSize: 'inherit',
    px: 3,
    py: 2,
    color: 'white',
    bg: 'primary',
    border: 0,
    borderRadius: 4,
  },
  sx
);

export default Button;
```

## Next steps

This is a simple approach for adding a powerful styling layer to your React components, allowing for flexibility while promoting development within the theme constraints.

I recommend checking out the Theme UI source code on how this technique is taken one step farther in adding theme-based [variants](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui/blob/stable/packages/components/src/Box.js#L13), [base styles](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui/blob/stable/packages/components/src/Box.js#L12), and hooking in [additional](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui/blob/stable/packages/components/src/Box.js#L4) prop conveniences from [Styled System].

You can expand on this technique by using your foundational `Box` component as the basis for all your UI pieces. More on that in part 2, [Building from the Box].
