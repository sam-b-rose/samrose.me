Here is a code example taken from the Quick Start of the `@xstate/react` [docs](https://xstate.js.org/docs/packages/xstate-react/#quick-start).

```jsx
import { useMachine } from '@xstate/react';
import { Machine } from 'xstate';

const toggleMachine = Machine({
  id: 'toggle',
  initial: 'inactive',
  states: {
    inactive: {
      on: { TOGGLE: 'active' },
    },
    active: {
      on: { TOGGLE: 'inactive' },
    },
  },
});

export const Toggler = () => {
  const [state, send] = useMachine(toggleMachine);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => send('TOGGLE')}>
      {state.value === 'inactive'
        ? 'Click to activate'
        : 'Active! Click to deactivate'}
    </button>
  );
};
```

Unfortunately you can't move the boxes. What you see is the states (the big boxes) and events (the small labels that start arrows) that define your state machine.

The tape player is initially stopped. The PLAY event moves it to playing. Basically you can move from playing to forwarding and back to playing, but if you want to be rewinding, you need to be stopped first.

You perform transitions by raising events. These events can be typed:
