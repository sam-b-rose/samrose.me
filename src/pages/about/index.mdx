Hi! I'm **Sam Rose**, a senior UX developer working with the talented folks at [Indeed] where we help people get jobs.

I am currently leading the Design System team, which designs and builds our company design system and other tools used at Indeed to deliver a consistent product experience.

Before Indeed, I had the pleasure of working with the wonderful people at [IBM], [GitLab], and [Cadre5].

I currently live and work in Austin, Texas where the tacos are delicious and the weather is warm. My dog, Franklin, and I keep it real down south by hiking the hills and paddling Lady Bird Lake.
