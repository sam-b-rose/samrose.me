Hi! I'm **Sam Rose**, a Senior Front End Developer working with the talented folks at [Shopify] where we are making commerce better for _everyone_.

Before Shopfiy, I had the pleasure of working with the wonderful people at [Indeed], [IBM], [GitLab], and [Cadre5].

I currently live and work in Austin, Texas where the tacos are delicious and the weather is warm. My dog, [Franklin], and I keep it real down south by hiking the hills and paddling Lady Bird Lake.
